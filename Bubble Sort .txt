# Bubble Sort :-

1) Algorithm :

		Start at the beginning of the list.
		Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
		If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.
		Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each pair of elements, moving from left to right.
		After each pass through the list, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end.
		Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion of the list.
		Stop when no more swaps are needed (the list is sorted

2) Psudo Code: 
		
		Step 1 : Start
		Step 2 : define an array 'arr' of size 'n'
		Step 3 : Loop i from 0 to n-1 (Outer Loop)
		Step 4 : Loop j from 0 to n-i-1 (inner loop)
			IF arr[j] > arr[j+1]
				THEN swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
		Step 5 : continue until the end of the outer loop
		Step 6 : The array is now sorted
		Step 7 : End
