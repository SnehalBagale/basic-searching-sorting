# Insertion Sort


1) Algorithm

	Start with the second element in the list (assuming the first element is already sorted).
	Compare this element with the elements in the sorted portion and insert it in the correct position.
	Repeat the process for all the remaining elements in the unsorted portion.
	The sorted portion grows with each insertion.

2) Pseudocode

		Start
		Input The array and the size N
		 FOR i = 1 to N-1 DO
             		key = A[i]
  			 j = i - 1
			WHILE j >= 0 AND A[j] > key DO
      				A[j+1] = A[j]  // Shift element to the right
      				 j = j - 1
    			END WHILE
   			A[j+1] = key  // Insert key at correct position
 		END FOR
