	Swap this smallest element with the first unsorted element.
	Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion of the list.
	Continue until the list is sorted

2) Psudo Code
	Step 1 : Start
	Step 2 : Input the array and size (n)
	Step 3 : LOOP i from 0 to n-2
		Set minIndex = i
		Loop j from i+1 to n-1
			if a[j] < a[minIndex]
				THEN minIndex = j 
		swap a[i] and a[minIndex]
	Step 4 : repeat until all elements are sorted
	Step 5 : Print Sorted array
	Step 6 : Stop
